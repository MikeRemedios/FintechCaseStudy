## Overview and Origin


Coinsquare was incorporated in 2014 by Virgile Rostand when he noticed the growing demand for a cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. In 2017, co-founder and ex-CEO Cole Diamond joined Rostand in the journey to build Coinsquare, receiving $30 million in venture capital funding that year, led by Canaccord Genuity. This funding allowed the team to hire up to 100 employees and grow the platform.
