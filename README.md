## Overview and Origin


Coinsquare was incorporated in 2014 by Virgile Rostand when he noticed the growing demand for a cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. In 2017, co-founder and ex-CEO Cole Diamond joined Rostand in the journey to build Coinsquare, receiving $30 million in venture capital funding that year, led by Canaccord Genuity. This funding allowed the team to hire up to 100 employees and grow the platform in order to serve the needs of their customers. The company has received a total of $40.4 million in its lifetime.



## Business Activities:


Coinsquare allows Canadians an easy way to buy and sell multiple cryptocurrencies, a task that was more difficult prior to its incorporation. Coinsquare seems to focus their efforts on providing a good client experience. They provide multiple trading platforms: one for basic trades and one with more advanced tools. Advanced trade includes tools to perform technical analysis, charting patterns and trend lines, as well as a collection of indicators that the user has and their disposal. Coinsquare has low, transparent fees that provide an easy entry for the majority of Canadians who are interested in starting their investments into the crypto domain. On top of that, Coinsquare provides extra benefits for high wealth clients; aptly named Coinsquare Wealth. Based on the size of trades, Wealth clients have lower fees and expedited services.

Coinsquare uses SSL and 2FA for security; not much else is known as they state their use of a "proprietary platform". Their website uses NGINX and Google Cloud Platform to manage the application and data. 


## Landscape:


The Cryptocurrency domain has gone from practically non-existent to a major headline in the last 10 years. Since 2017, the domain has shifted dramatically from the product - the currency - to the business. Currency exchanges, Coinsquare included, have become much more professional, exploding in size. This huge expansion into the realm of finance resulted in the next big trend of the domain - regulation. With players all across the world from varying industries, regulation became very important, especially with the anonymous nature of crypto.

The most recent trend in crypto is the advent of DeFi - decentralized finance. DeFi is an open source network that challenges the traditional financial industry by being completely transparent and automated with smart contracts, eliminating the middleman when it comes to buying and selling securities. DeFi differs from regular cryptocurrencies as it uses currency known as a stablecoin. Stablecoins have their value tied to fiat currencies, where cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are extremely volatile and their value is completely impacted by the market.


## Recommendations


One of the biggest competitors in the space is Coinbase, and while Coinsquare is extremely accessible to Canadians, Coinbase offers a much more advanced trading platform. Also, Coinbase has dedicated support staff while Coinsquare uses an automated ticket support system. With live support similar to Coinbase, Coinsquare could improve their goal of providing good client experience without much trouble - all it would take is to hire more staff. Unfortunately, security concerns surrounding Coinsquare and their lawsuit have disuaded Canadians from using their platform, resulting in the company laying off staff. With a new CEO, Coinsquare can aim to retake control of the Canadian crypto exchange market.
